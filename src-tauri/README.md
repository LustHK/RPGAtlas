# RPGAtlas — Desktop wrapper (Tauri)

This folder packages the existing static RPGAtlas editor as a native desktop
app using [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app). The web/local-server build (run
`RPGAtlas.exe`) is unaffected — the desktop wrapper is an additional target,
not a replacement.

## How it works

- The editor/player are the same files served by the local web server. A small
  staging step (`scripts/stage-frontend.mjs`) copies `index.html`, `play.html`,
  `css/`, `js/`, `img/`, and `bin/` into `src-tauri/dist/`, which Tauri embeds.
- That step also writes `img/assets.json`, the manifest `js/assets.js` already
  prefers over HTTP directory-listing discovery — so custom art works inside the
  app, which has no directory listings.
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` adds three native commands: `save_project` /
  `open_project` (native file dialogs) and `open_playtest` (dedicated window).
  The frontend reaches them through `js/editor/host.js`; on the plain web build
  `host.isTauri` is false and callers fall back to browser behavior.
- Autosave keeps using `localStorage`, which works normally because Tauri serves
  the app from a real origin (unlike `file://`).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (for the staging script and the Tauri CLI) — already used here.
- **Rust toolchain** — install via <https://rustup.rs>. Tauri compiles a small
  native shell in Rust.
- **Platform WebView + build tools:**
  - Windows: WebView2 runtime (preinstalled on Win 10/11) + MSVC Build Tools.
  - macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools.
  - Linux: `webkit2gtk` and related dev packages (see Tauri prerequisites).

## Develop / build

Run from the repository root:

```sh
npm install          # one-time: fetches @tauri-apps/cli
npm run dev          # live desktop app (stages frontend, then tauri dev)
npm run build        # produces an installer in src-tauri/target/release/bundle
```

## Icons

A Windows icon (`icons/icon.ico`) is included from `img/system/rpgatlas.ico`.
For full cross-platform installers, regenerate the icon set from a square
source image (the logo SVG rendered to a 1024×1024 PNG works well):

```sh
npm run tauri icon path/to/logo-1024.png
```

then add the generated files to the `bundle.icon` array in `tauri.conf.json`.
